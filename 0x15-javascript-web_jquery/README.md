#0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery

In this project, I learned how to use jQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Throughout the project, I learned how to select HTML elements using both JavaScript and jQuery, the differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors, how to modify an HTML element's style and content, and how to modify the DOM. Additionally, I learned how to make GET and POST requests with jQuery Ajax, how to listen/bind to DOM and user events.

Some resources that helped me during the project include oscarotero.com and learn.jquery.com.
